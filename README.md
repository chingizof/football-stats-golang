# football-stats-golang
Service for football scouts to receive data and statistics of players. 

First experience with chi library, which I used to handle requests easier.
Additionally, used more advanced server infrastructure with incapsulation and interface repositories, which allow switching between players and coaches market. 
Use Postgres as a DB
